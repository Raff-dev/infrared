## Development setup

Build the Docker images:

    docker-compose build

For any actions concerning database usage like migrations, testing, creating superuser you're going to need the database.    
Here's how you can start it as a detached (running in background) container:

    docker-compose up -d database

Do not forget to run migrations:

    docker-compose run backend python manage.py migrate

Run the development application:

    docker-compose up backend
    # or alternatively run all the services at once
    docker-compose up

Access the server locally with port 8000:

    http://localhost:8000


Install pre-commit hooks:

    pre-commit install

### You're also going to need an .env file, so have a look at this [example](./.env.example).

### Now you're ready to roll ðŸ˜Ž

## Amazon S3 Storage
In order to work on S3 bucket, you're going to need to set this env variable:

    DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=api.settings.storage
    # of course you'll also going to need all the AWS credentials

Otherwise use this settings module to work on a local store:

    DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=api.settings.local

## Poetry
Here are some helpful poetry commands in case you need to alter the dependencies.

    poetry install # installing dependencies
    poetry shell   # run virtual environment shell
    poetry add     # add a dependency
    poetry remove  # remove a dependency
    poetry update  # update dependency list
    poetry show    # list isntalled dependencies
## Testing    
! Make sure you have `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=api.settings.local` specified in your .env or container environment !

    docker-compose run backend pytest -s
---

## Pre-commit

    pre-commit                  # runs pre-commit for staged files only
    pre-commit run {hook_id}    # run specified hoot
    pre-commit run --all-files  # run for all files

## Django commands

    docker-compose run backend python manage.py {your_command} {your_args}

## Deployment & Checks

Deployment as well as static code checks and running tests is fully automated using Github actions.   
Push to `feature/*` and `main` branches triggers code checks and tests.   
Push to `main` branch automatically triggers deploy to `AWS ECS`.

## Documentation

You can find interactive Swagger documentation on the main page of the app.
